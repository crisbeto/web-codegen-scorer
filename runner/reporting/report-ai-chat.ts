  return `## What is a report?
A report consists of many apps that were LLM generated. You will have information
about checks that failed for this LLM generated app.

Note that there may be multiple attempts for an app. E.g. an initial build may fail and
another attempt might have repaired the build failure. The last attempt reflects the final
state of the app. E.g. whether it does build, or if there are runtime errors.

## Scoring mechanism
Apps are rated based on their scores in the following buckets:
${BUCKET_CONFIG.map(b => `* ${b.name}: ${b.min}-${b.max}`).join('\n')}

The overall score of an app is determined based on score reductions.
There are ${categoryCount} pillars: ${Object.keys(pointsForCategories).join(', ')}
Pillars are a split up of a 100% perfect score, allowing for individual ratings
to be less impactful than others. The pillars are distributed as follows:
${Object.entries(pointsForCategories).map(e => `* ${e[0]}: ${e[1]} points.`)}
Within pillars, the available score can be reduced by individual ratings.
